# No Show Appointment Project

## Introduction:
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of patients to predict their likelihood of not showing up for appointments. The dataset includes various number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
By analyzing these factors, I built a model to predict whether a patient will attend their appointment or not.

## Requirements:
- **Panda**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy** :For performing numerical and mathematical operations.
- **Matplotlip**: For creating visualizations and plots.

## Project Files:
- Investigate_a_Dataset.html: This HTML file is the converted version of the Jupyter notebook
- Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis
- noshowapp_dataset.csv: The CSV file containing the patient dataset
- README.md: This file that explains the project

## What I learned:
- Statistical Analysis: I practiced performing basic statistical analysis, such as calculating the mean, to gain insights from the data
- Data Preprocessing: I gained experience in cleaning and preparing data for analysis, handling missing values, and understanding how to structure data for better insights
- Visualization: I learned how to visualize the results of my analysis using matplotlib, helping to communicate the findings more clearly
